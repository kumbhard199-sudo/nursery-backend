All endpoints except `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/setup` require JWT authentication.

### Login Flow

1. **Setup (One-time)**
```bash
POST /api/auth/setup
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "Admin@123"
}
```

2. **Login**
```bash
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "Admin@123"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "data": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    "admin": {
      "id": 1,
      "username": "admin",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }

## 💼 Business Logic

### Stock Calculation
```javascript
Remaining Crops = Total Produced - Sold Crops - Dead Crops
```

### Billing Calculation
```javascript
Final Bill = (Crop Quantity × Price Per Crop) + Traveling Cost + Plantation Cost
```

### Worker Salary Calculation
```javascript
Monthly Salary = (Full Days × ₹400) + (Half Days × ₹200) + (Extra Hours × ₹50) - Borrowed Amount
```

### Profit Calculation
```javascript
Profit = Total Sales Income - Raw Material Expenses - Worker Salaries
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Models

- **Admin**: System administrator credentials
- **Batch**: Crop production batches
- **Customer**: Customer information
- **Sale**: Sales transactions
- **Worker**: Worker details
- **Attendance**: Daily worker attendance
- **RawMaterial**: Raw material purchases

### Relationships

- One Batch → Many Sales
- One Customer → Many Sales
- One Worker → Many Attendance records

## 🔄 Automatic Backups

The system automatically backs up the PostgreSQL database daily at 2 AM (configurable).

- Backups stored in `/backups` directory
- Old backups (30+ days) automatically deleted
- Manual backup can be triggered programmatically

## 📝 Default Credentials (After Seeding)

```
Username: admin
Password: admin123
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Change these credentials immediately in production!

## 🚀 Production Deployment

1. Set `NODE_ENV=production`
2. Use strong `JWT_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters)
3. Update database credentials
4. Enable SSL/HTTPS
5. Configure firewall rules
6. Set up monitoring and logging
